JSON is simple. There is already a standard config for 1 pin.

Pin 17 with a default value of ffalse (off) and power directed out.

This server uses the `pi_piper` gem, so if you want to learn more, go check it out!

Otherwise, to add more pins and related directions, just add more info to the gpio_config.json file :)

All pins must have default state and direction!!!
